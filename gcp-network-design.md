## GCP Virtual Networking
- Networking services provide connectivity between cloud-based VMs, on-premises servers, and other cloud services. Google Cloud treats networking as a global feature that spans all its services. GCP networking is based on Google’s Andromeda architecture, which allows cloud administrators to create and use software-defined networking elements, such as firewalls, routing tables, and VMs.

## A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Network
Virtual Private Cloud Network or simply network is a virtual version of a physical network. In Google Cloud Networking, networks provide data connections into and out of cloud resources – mostly Compute Engine instances. 
> Securing the Networks is critical to securing the data and controlling access to the resources.

- Google Cloud Networking achieves flexible and logical isolation of unrelated resources through its different levels.
